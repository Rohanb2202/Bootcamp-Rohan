    <h2>SKB Research Papers</h2>

    <ol><strong>Layout and Structure:</strong>
        <li>The search interface offers a clean design with essential filtering capabilities including year range selection and a search-by-title feature</li>
        <li>User-friendly cards-per-page selector enhances viewing flexibility (observed value of 50)</li>
        <li>Each research paper card effectively displays key metadata: authors, year, venue, citations, and abstract preview</li>
        <li>The pagination system shows current page position (1 of 20), though the page numbers beyond the immediate next page are not clearly visible</li>
        <li>Export Filtered Data functionality is present but requires clearer indication of supported export formats</li>
        <li>"Read more" feature for abstracts maintains clean card layout while allowing access to full content</li>
        <li>The consistent card layout makes scanning through multiple papers efficient</li>
    </ol>

    <ol><strong>Visual Design:</strong>
        <li>Professional white background with blue accent colors creates excellent contrast</li>
        <li>Typography hierarchy effectively distinguishes paper titles from metadata</li>
        <li>Interactive elements like "Read more" links are consistently styled in red</li>
        <li>Citations display maintains good visibility without overwhelming the card design</li>
        <li>Appropriate spacing between cards and elements improves readability</li>
        <li>Clean, modern design approach focuses attention on research content</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>City Weather</h2>

    <ol><strong>Layout and Structure:</strong>
        <li>Simple and intuitive city search interface with a clear input field</li>
        <li>Weather information presented in a card format showing temperature and wind speed</li>
        <li>Basic navigation between Home and Page 2 (About page) is functional but minimal</li>
        <li>Weather updates appear to be real-time but lack comprehensive metrics</li>
        <li>Missing important weather data points like humidity, precipitation, and forecast</li>
        <li>Context-aware weather messages add personality ("Don't forget your coat!" for cold weather)</li>
    </ol>

    <ol><strong>Visual Design:</strong>
        <li>Pleasing gradient backgrounds (blue for main page, peach for about page)</li>
        <li>Temperature display is prominent and easily readable</li>
        <li>Consistent card design across different city weather displays</li>
        <li>Wind speed information is subtly integrated without cluttering the display</li>
        <li>Clean spacing and alignment throughout the interface</li>
        <li>Text contrast is well-maintained across both light and dark sections</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Overall Rating: 7/10</h2>
    <p>Both applications demonstrate solid foundational design but have room for improvement. The Research Explorer excels in data presentation and filtering capabilities, though pagination visibility needs enhancement. The interface successfully balances information density with readability, making it effective for academic research browsing. The Weather Dashboard offers a clean, minimalist approach that works well for basic weather checking, but could benefit from additional weather metrics and forecasting features. The context-aware weather messages are a nice touch that adds user value. While both applications serve their core purposes well, strategic enhancements could significantly improve their utility.</p>
