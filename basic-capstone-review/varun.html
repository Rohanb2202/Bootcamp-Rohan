    <h2>Research Papers Explorer</h2>

    <ol><strong>Layout and Structure:</strong>
        <li>Clean search interface with year range selection and title filtering capabilities</li>
        <li>All papers load simultaneously instead of proper pagination, which could impact performance with large datasets</li>
        <li>Research paper cards effectively display metadata including authors, year, venue, and abstracts</li>
        <li>Export Filtered Data feature available but lacks clear format indicators</li>
        <li>Efficient "Read more" implementation for abstract expansion</li>
        <li>Dark theme provides good contrast for extended reading sessions</li>
        <li>ID display for each paper seems unnecessary for general users</li>
    </ol>

    <ol><strong>Visual Design:</strong>
        <li>Professional dark theme with cyan accents for paper titles</li>
        <li>Clear typography hierarchy differentiating titles from metadata</li>
        <li>Consistent styling of interactive elements in blue</li>
        <li>Well-maintained spacing between cards and elements</li>
        <li>Author names highlighted in gold provide good visual emphasis</li>
        <li>Clean card layout enables quick scanning of research content</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Weather Widget</h2>

    <ol><strong>Layout and Structure:</strong>
        <li>Straightforward city search with clear input field</li>
        <li>Basic temperature display for selected cities</li>
        <li>Simple navigation between pages using "Go to Page-2" and "Back to Page-1"</li>
        <li>Missing crucial weather metrics like humidity and wind speed</li>
        <li>No forecast functionality limits utility</li>
        <li>Inconsistent temperature values between pages (35.2°C vs 32.4°C for Los Angeles)</li>
    </ol>

    <ol><strong>Visual Design:</strong>
        <li>Pleasing gradient blue background creates calming atmosphere</li>
        <li>Temperature display is clear and prominent</li>
        <li>Consistent white card design for weather information</li>
        <li>Clean button styling with good contrast</li>
        <li>Minimalist design focuses attention on essential information</li>
        <li>Professional spacing and alignment throughout</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Overall Rating: 6/10</h2>
    <p>Both applications show promise but require significant improvements. The Research Explorer needs proper pagination implementation and could benefit from removing unnecessary ID displays. The interface successfully presents academic content but should optimize for larger datasets. The Weather Widget offers a clean, minimalist approach but lacks essential weather information and consistency between pages. While both applications achieve basic functionality, they need refinement to become more robust tools. The Research Explorer's dark theme and the Weather Widget's gradient background demonstrate good aesthetic choices, but functionality should be prioritized in future updates.</p>
