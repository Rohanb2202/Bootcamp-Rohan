    <h2>Streamify Music Interface</h2>

    <ol><strong>Layout and Structure:</strong>
        <li>The dual search system with artist and song name fields provides flexible search options, though the interface could be more integrated</li>
        <li>The card-based grid layout effectively organizes song information, making it easy to scan through multiple tracks</li>
        <li>The filtering system with Genre and Popularity Level dropdowns offers good data organization</li>
        <li>The "Download Filtered Data" button is well-positioned and clearly visible</li>
        <li>The pagination system at the bottom adequately handles the large dataset (1642 pages)</li>
        <li>While the dark theme looks modern, some elements lack sufficient contrast</li>
        <li>The song cards take up significant vertical space, leading to more scrolling than necessary</li>
        <li>No visual indication of active filters - users can't quickly see their current filter selections</li>
        <li>The download button doesn't specify the export format or options</li>
    </ol>

    <ol><strong>Visual Design:</strong>
        <li>The Spotify-inspired dark theme creates a professional, modern aesthetic</li>
        <li>Typography clearly differentiates between song titles, artists, and metadata</li>
        <li>The green accent color effectively highlights interactive elements</li>
        <li>Song duration and popularity indicators are consistently placed</li>
        <li>Play buttons could be more prominent given their importance</li>
        <li>Genre tags appear as static text when they could serve as interactive filters</li>
        <li>Album names could benefit from better visual hierarchy</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Weather Dashboard</h2>

    <ol><strong>Layout and Structure:</strong>
        <li>Simple city search interface with clear input field and action button</li>
        <li>Clean presentation of weather information in card format</li>
        <li>The weather cards show essential metrics in a logical organization</li>
        <li>Temperature display is prominent and easy to read</li>
        <li>The city search lacks autocomplete functionality</li>
        <li>No indication of when weather data was last updated</li>
        <li>Missing critical weather alerts or warnings</li>
        <li>No option to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit</li>
        <li>Absence of extended forecast information</li>
    </ol>

    <ol><strong>Visual Design:</strong>
        <li>The lavender-blue gradient cards create a pleasant visual experience</li>
        <li>Weather icons effectively communicate current conditions</li>
        <li>The white text on colored backgrounds maintains good readability</li>
        <li>The minimalist design keeps focus on important weather data</li>
        <li>Temperature displays could benefit from additional context (high/low)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Overall Rating: 7/10</h2>
    <p>While both applications demonstrate solid foundational design principles, they have room for improvement in key areas. The Streamify interface successfully adapts Spotify's design language while maintaining its own identity, though it could benefit from more intuitive filtering mechanisms. The Weather Dashboard, while visually appealing with its clean design, needs additional functionality to compete with modern weather applications. Both applications prioritize aesthetics but could use enhancements in user interaction and information display to better serve their core purposes.</p>
