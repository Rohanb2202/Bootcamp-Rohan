    <h2>Research Papers Explorer (Paper-Vista)</h2>

    <ol><strong>Layout and Structure:</strong>
        <li>Clean filter interface with essential parameters: title, citations, date range, and records per page</li>
        <li>The purple-themed header and clear filter button provide good visual organization</li>
        <li>Research papers are displayed in card format with consistent spacing and hierarchy</li>
        <li>Export functionality is prominently placed but lacks format specification</li>
        <li>Citation counts and venue information are clearly visible</li>
        <li>The paper abstracts could be better truncated to avoid text overflow</li>
        <li>No visual feedback for active filters</li>
        <li>Missing advanced search options for authors and institutions</li>
        <li>Paper cards take up excessive vertical space</li>
    </ol>

    <ol><strong>Visual Design:</strong>
        <li>Purple theme creates a professional, academic aesthetic</li>
        <li>Typography effectively distinguishes between titles, authors, and metadata</li>
        <li>The "Read More" links need better visual prominence</li>
        <li>Citation counts could be more visually emphasized given their importance</li>
        <li>Venue names lack proper formatting and linking</li>
        <li>Abstract text requires better contrast against the background</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Weather Widget</h2>

    <ol><strong>Layout and Structure:</strong>
        <li>Minimalist city search interface with straightforward functionality</li>
        <li>Weather information presented in a clean, focused card format</li>
        <li>Multi-page layout with intuitive navigation between pages</li>
        <li>Background images effectively complement weather conditions</li>
        <li>Clear temperature display with accompanying weather description</li>
        <li>Search functionality lacks autocomplete suggestions</li>
        <li>Missing extended forecast information</li>
        <li>No weather alerts system</li>
        <li>Absence of additional weather metrics (humidity, wind speed)</li>
    </ol>

    <ol><strong>Visual Design:</strong>
        <li>Atmospheric background images enhance the weather context</li>
        <li>Weather icons and temperature display maintain good visibility</li>
        <li>Weather Card hasn't properly positioned</li>
        <li>Page navigation buttons are clearly visible and well-positioned</li>
        <li>Text remains readable against varying background conditions</li>
        <li>Weather advice ("Dress accordingly!") adds practical value</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Overall Rating: 7/10</h2>
    <p>Both applications demonstrate solid fundamentals but have room for improvement. Paper-Vista effectively organizes research content though it needs refinement in its filtering system and visual hierarchy. The Weather Widget succeeds with its clean, focused design but could benefit from additional weather metrics and forecasting features. The applications prioritize simplicity while maintaining core functionality, making them suitable for their intended purposes despite their limitations.</p>
