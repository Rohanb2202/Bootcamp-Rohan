    <h2>Weather Widget</h2>

    <ol><strong>Layout and Structure:</strong>
        <li>Basic city search functionality with limited weather metrics</li>
        <li>Current weather icon with mist condition shows basic weather status</li>
        <li>Temperature display could be more prominent given it's the main feature</li>
        <li>Critical features missing: wind speed, humidity, precipitation chance</li>
    </ol>

    <ol><strong>Visual Design:</strong>
        <li>Background image, while visually appealing, may impact load times</li>
        <li>Weather information card lacks visual hierarchy</li>
        <li>Button styling is inconsistent with modern design patterns</li>
        <li>Text contrast needs improvement for better accessibility</li>
        <li>Weather icon appears generic and could be more detailed</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Overall Rating: 6/10</h2>
    <p>The Weather Widget demonstrates basic functionality but falls short in several areas. While the aesthetic choice of the misty background creates atmosphere, it potentially sacrifices performance. The minimal weather data limits practical utility. The interface needs significant improvement in both feature set and visual hierarchy. Future updates should focus on comprehensive weather information and refined user interface elements.</p>
