    <h2>Research Paper Bank</h2>

    <ol><strong>Layout and Structure:</strong>
        <li>Clear interface with effective filtering options including Author, Year, Category, Rating, and Date</li>
        <li>Cards per page selector offers flexibility in data viewing</li>
        <li>Navigation lacks a "Previous" button, making backwards page traversal impossible</li>
        <li>Research paper cards display consistent metadata including ID, rating, and publication date</li>
        <li>Export Data feature available but format options not specified</li>
        <li>Clean implementation of abstract previews with "Read More" functionality</li>
        <li>Effective use of cards layout for displaying research papers</li>
    </ol>

    <ol><strong>Visual Design:</strong>
        <li>Professional dark theme maintains good readability</li>
        <li>Clear typography hierarchy between titles and metadata</li>
        <li>Consistent styling of interactive elements</li>
        <li>Rating system visually integrated into paper cards</li>
        <li>Effective use of white space between elements</li>
        <li>Blue accent color highlights interactive elements effectively</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Weather Dashboard</h2>

    <ol><strong>Layout and Structure:</strong>
        <li>Simple city search interface with straightforward weather display</li>
        <li>Basic temperature and condition information clearly presented</li>
        <li>Navigation between pages via Home and Page 2 links</li>
        <li>Missing extended weather data and forecasting</li>
        <li>Lacks additional weather metrics like humidity and wind speed</li>
        <li>Weather condition icon implementation needs improvement</li>
    </ol>

    <ol><strong>Visual Design:</strong>
        <li>Clean blue gradient theme but it wasn't visually pleasing</li>
        <li>Large, readable temperature display</li>
        <li>Weather condition text clearly visible</li>
        <li>Minimalist design focuses on core information</li>
        <li>Consistent spacing and alignment throughout</li>
        <li>Good contrast between text and background</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Overall Rating: 6.5/10</h2>
    <p>Both applications show potential but require refinements. The Research Paper Bank needs critical navigation improvements, particularly adding a "Previous" button for better user experience. The Weather Dashboard's minimalist approach works well visually but lacks essential weather metrics and forecasting capabilities. The research explorer excels in data organization despite navigation limitations, while the weather dashboard prioritizes simplicity over comprehensive functionality.</p>
