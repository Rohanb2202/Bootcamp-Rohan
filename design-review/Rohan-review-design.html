            <h3>Meta Review</h3>
            <p>The website provides a clear and consistent way to review design submissions. The <code>index.html</code> page lists all the available submissions, making navigation and review straightforward. The <code>notes.html</code> files for each submission offer valuable insights into the thought process and design choices. While there is no explicit mention of any LLM used, I included dummy links to maintain the structure, ensuring users recognize them as placeholders and avoid interacting with them.</p>
            
            <h3>Review</h3>
            <a href="https://stellular-marshmallow-b77b25.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Website</a><br>
            
            <h3>Overall Rating</h3>
            <div class="rating">7/10</div>
            <p>The submission presents a clean and visually appealing layout. The use of typography, color, and spacing creates a harmonious and engaging user experience. The design effectively communicates the content and adheres to the guidelines provided. Some areas that could be improved include adding more interactive elements or subtle animations to enhance the overall user engagement. The websites presents a well-designed and user-friendly interface that effectively showcases the power of CSS-based design. The overall layout was well-organized. The visual design of the website is minimalistic and focused, allowing the design submissions to take center stage. The website appears to be responsive, adapting well to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures a consistent and accessible user experience across various platforms. I'd say this webpage is well-structured and emphasizes visual hierarchy. It meets all the necessary requirements outlined in the checklist for the exercises. Also the article webpage was quite closely resembles to an medium article. While it is visually appealing, it is also responsive.</p>
            
            <h3>Pros</h3>
            <ul class="pros">
                <li>Clean and intuitive layout</li>
                <li>Effective organization of content</li>
                <li>Minimalistic and visually appealing design</li>
                <li>Responsive design</li>
                <li>The overall aesthetic is modern, clean, and visually striking, with good use of whitespace and a balanced composition.</li>
                <li>Follows visual hierarchy</li>
                <li>Well structured and aligned</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Cons</h3>
            <ul class="cons">
                <li>Limited interactive elements</li>
                <li>Potential for more creative or dynamic design elements</li>
                <li>Some of the text-heavy sections could potentially be made more engaging through the use of more graphics, diagrams, or interactive elements.</li>
                <li>Negligence of modern css techniques</li>
                <li>For the exercise 6 I could have redesign it a bit more interactive</li>
                <li>Also could've improvised the UI part as well</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>Overall, these websites is a well-designed platform for showcasing and reviewing CSS-based design submissions. The clear structure, consistent formatting, and thoughtful design choices make it easy to navigate and evaluate the various solutions. While some submissions may benefit from additional interactive or dynamic elements, the majority of the designs demonstrate a strong understanding of CSS and a commitment to creating visually striking and user-friendly experiences. The website demonstrates an embryonic stage of design capability, suggesting potential for future development with continued learning and practice in user experience and interface design.</p>

            <p>After carefully examining the design of each exercise's solution, it is evident that the overall quality isn't impressive. The UI is neither visually appealing nor responsive. Considering that the primary goal of this assessment is to craft a well-designed webpage, this website falls short in meeting those expectations.</p>
            
            <h3>Pros</h3>
            <ul class="pros">
                <li>The theme switching page and image overlay text solution were well-executed.</li>

                <li>Most of the web pages lacked proper structure and alignment.</li>
                <li>Both the header and footer could have been designed better.</li>

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>Overall, this website isn't designed well enough. The design is too simple and could have been much better. Although some parts were responsive, the overall UI lacks structure, responsiveness, and visual fidelity.</p>

            <p>After carefully reviewing each exercise's solution, I can say that the way this website was crafted is truly wonderful, and the creator deserves appreciation for their work and creativity. The navigation is impressive, as it connects to each solution appropriately. The UI is well-structured, and some design features stand out. The redesigned versions of IRCTC and IITM, in particular, are significantly better compared to their original designs.</p>
            
            <h3>Pros</h3>
            <ul class="pros">

                <li>Some of the web pages follow visual hierarchy, which is great.</li>

            <h3>Cons</h3>
            <ul class="cons">
                <li>The header could have been styled better using appropriate CSS techniques.</li>
                <li>In exercise one, the footer wasn't styled properly.</li>
                <li>The hyperlinks were slightly confusing, as navigating to the first solution requires traversing through other solutions in between, which can be inconvenient.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>Although it is visually pleasing and responsive, it isn't entirely user-friendly, as the navigation has both advantages and drawbacks.</p>
