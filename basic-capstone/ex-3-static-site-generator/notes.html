            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">What if you have to redesign amazon.com or flipkart in static website? So far, you have shown that with static website without any REST APIs, you can do lot of things. To do amazon.com like site, here is what else you need to do:</p>
               <ul>
                <li>You need to have a static site generation -- that is, you are not going to create millions of catalog items by hand. May be that data is in a database. You have to build it with a program -- not on demand (that requires a app server), but statically (which can be hosted on netlify or cloudflare for free).</li>
                <li>You need to support search on the client side. That is, somehow some javascript magic should work to allow you to do search. (You might have implemented search in your filters. But that is not the same as search -- you need to drop filler words, support word stems, proximity searches, typos and all that).</li>
                <li>And, understand the limits. How big a catalog can you support -- or more accurately, the browser support? Is there a way to optimize it?</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>My Approach</h2>
            <ol>
               <li>First, I decided to structure the project with a component-based architecture for better maintainability and reusability. I separated the UI into distinct components - header, search bar, product grid, and filters - each handling its own functionality. This modular approach made the code more organized and easier to debug.</li>
               <li>For the data management, I implemented a static JSON-based catalog system. Rather than relying on a backend server, I created a comprehensive products.json file that stores all product information including alternate names, categories, and image fallbacks. This approach allowed me to demonstrate how a static site can handle complex product catalogs efficiently.</li>
               <li>One of the key challenges was implementing client-side search without a backend. I built a sophisticated search system using JavaScript that handles real-time suggestions, supports alternative product names, and includes basic error correction. I used debouncing to optimize performance and ensure smooth user experience even with larger datasets.</li>
               <li>For the styling architecture with the help of Claude AI, I took a mobile-first approach using modern CSS features. I utilized CSS Grid for the product layout, Flexbox for navigation components, and implemented smooth transitions for interactive elements. I paid special attention to responsiveness, ensuring the site works well across all device sizes.</li>
