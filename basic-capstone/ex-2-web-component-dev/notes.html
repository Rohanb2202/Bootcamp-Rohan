            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Web Components let you create custom, reusable elements for your website that work like regular HTML tags. They include built-in tools to keep your styles and code separate from the rest of the page, so nothing breaks. You can use them with any framework or on their own, making them super flexible. They make it easier to build and reuse parts of your site, like buttons or menus, across different projects. With Web Components, you get cleaner code and faster development.</p>
               <ul>
                <li>Write a weather widget that takes a name and outputs the weather neatly: <code> <city-weather city="Los Angeles"></city-weather> </code></li>
                <li>By default, use use LA. And, use a form to let the user enter the city name. And, update the attribute of the element by selecting it.</li>
                <li>Now, keep the widget in a separate JS module. Show two pages that use the widget.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>My Approach</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>First, As per the project constraints I decided to use Web Components so that each weather card to be completely self-contained and reusable. This made the code much cleaner and easier to maintain. I created a custom CityWeather component that handles everything about displaying weather data - from fetching it to showing loading states and errors.</li>
                <li>For the overall architecture, I went with a Single Page Application approach. I built a main WeatherDashboard class that handles view switching between single city and comparison modes. I added smooth transitions between views using CSS animations to make it feel polished.</li>
                    
                <li>For styling, I set up CSS custom properties for consistent theming across the app. I heavily used modern CSS features like flexbox, grid, and backdrop filters to create that nice glassmorphism effect on the cards. I made sure everything was responsive from the start using a mobile-first approach.</li>
                <li>Finally I integrated with the OpenWeatherMap API and put a lot of thought into handling different states - loading, errors, and success. Each weather card shows appropriate loading spinners and error messages when needed. I also added dynamic backgrounds that change based on the weather conditions, which really brings the cards to life.</li>
                <li>Looking back, I really wanted to say this that crafting a website based on components and clean architechure made it easy for adding new features and also to isolate any kinda error.</li>
